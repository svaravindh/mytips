## Tips for Proof reading

### Proofread backwards

Whenever I mention that proofreading your text from the end of your content to the beginning is my favorite proofreading method, 
We don’t always have a day to let our writing sit before we edit and proof it. That’s great advice in theory, but not realistic in a fast-paced content publishing environment.
Proofreading backwards helps you see your writing with fresh eyes, without first putting it aside for 24 hours.

In addition to spotting actual errors, you’ll also likely find:

    Words you overuse
    Sentences you can clarify
    Paragraphs you can simplify

Give it a try the next time you need to polish a fresh draft before you publish.

### Stop at every punctuation mark

Proofreading is all about paying attention to little details that help your audience effortlessly understand your message.
Pause at every comma, period, apostrophe, quotation mark, etc. to make sure you’ve used them correctly.

This tip is especially helpful to find “it’s/it” and “they’re/their/there” mistakes.

### Scan the first word of each paragraph

Varying your word choice elevates your content to a more sophisticated level.
If a number of your paragraphs begin with the same word, your writing won’t be as dynamic as it could be.

### Verify spellings of people’s names

Google is a proofreader’s best friend.
Keep a Google search tab open when you proofread and look up the proper spelling of every name in your text.

### Verify spellings of company names

When the name of a proper noun is spelled correctly, your audience takes it for granted.
However, when a knowledgable reader spots a spelling or letter-case error, it makes an article look sloppy.
It could be “copy blogger” or “CopyBlogger,” instead of the correct spelling: “Copyblogger.”

    An incorrect spelling of a name isn’t a typo; it’s a mistake.

Performing a final spell-check is an important part of proofreading, so I’ve dedicated several of these tips to items professionals verify … in every piece of content.
